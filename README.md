# Synthetic Apriori Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the Apriori algorithm using synthetic transactional datasets. The synthetic data allows users to experiment with frequent itemset mining and association rule generation without relying on external data sources.

## Features
- Generate synthetic transactional datasets.
- Find frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm.
- Generate association rules with customizable thresholds.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: numpy , iters.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SyntheticAprioriProject.git
